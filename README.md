This JavaScript algorithm helps you find out which people don't follow you back on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com).

Therefore, it tries to identify which users you follow, and which ones follow you, stores this data in a temporary memory, compares them and prints the desired result on the screen.

## Usage

To perform this analysis, access a user's Instagram account page on your computer, copy [this script](script.js) and paste it into your console, which can be accessed from the shortcut `CTRL + SHIFT + I`.

You can also type the [Uniform Resource Identifier](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/URI) `javascript:` in your search bar and paste the script directly on the page to run.

```
javascript: # Paste the script here
```
